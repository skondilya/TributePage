      <h3>Our beloved llama</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>  
        	Llamas make excellent guards for herds of small animals. They are very social and will ‘adopt’ a group of sheep or goats as their own herd. Then they will protect the herd by chasing off coyotes and other predators.
        </li>
        <li>
			Llamas are smart. They can distinguish between the neighbor’s dog and a predatory coyote.
			Llamas are the camel’s hippie cousins. They belong to a group of animals called camelids that also includes alpacas. All camelids spit or stick out their tongue when they are annoyed.
        </li>
        <li>
One of the ways llamas communicate is by humming.
        </li>
        <li>
			Llamas are diabetic — sort of. The OSU College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is using their herd of 30 llamas and alpacas to study how certain hormones affect blood sugar. Because the metabolism of llamas is very similar to that of a human diabetic, the results of this research may provide insight into human diabetes treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
        	Llamas can grow as much as 6 feet tall though the average llama between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall.
        </li>
         <li>
         	Llamas know their own limits. If you try to overload a llama with too much weight, the llama is likely to lie down or simply refuse to move.
        </li>
         <li>
            Llamas are social animals and prefer to live with other llamas or herd animals. The social structure of llamas changes frequently and a male llama can move up the social ladder by picking, and winning, small fights with the leader of the group.
        </li>
        <li>
        	The current population of llamas and alpacas in South America is estimated to be more than 7 million.
        </li>
        <li>
        	Trying to tell the difference between a llama and an alpaca? Two obvious things to look for: Llamas are generally about twice the size of alpacas, and alpacas have short, pointy ears, whereas llamas have much longer ears that stand straight up and give them an alert look.
        </li>
      </ul>
